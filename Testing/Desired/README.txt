Testing procedure: 

1) Make an OpenSimTrial and do ID on it. 
2) Make the joints and multiplier arguments.
3) Pass these along with the descriptor to the desired.
4) Do the setup. 
5) Compare Desired.IDTrial and Desired.Result. 
6) Some sample graphs of the test I did are provided for hip flexion joints l/r, using
	0.5 multipliers.
