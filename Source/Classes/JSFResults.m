classdef JSFResults
    % Just a small class for holding the (known - i.e. no active exoskeleton
    % component) joint-space forces associated with an OpenSimTrial. Remember 
    % to at some point investigate not doing this and just using a variant of 
    % inverse dynamics.

    methods
        % Construct JSFResults. Requires running getJointSpaceForces with
        % the appropriate command-line arguments, printing files
        % (unfortunately - until I can MEX this) and then reading them back
        % in as Data files. The actual running is done as a method in the
        % OpenSimTrial class.
