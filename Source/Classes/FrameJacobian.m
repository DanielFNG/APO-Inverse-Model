classdef FrameJacobian
    % An individual FrameJacobian.
    %   This is associated with a name, a body, a point on that body to
    %   which some force could be applied (for example). Finally, a MatrixData
    %   object which stores the Jacobian itself (including the timesteps).
    %   There is also an association to a states file, for example one
    %   corresponding to an RRAResults object. 
    %
    %   Note that FrameJacobians are calculated in sets and so
    %   FrameJacobianSet is what actually does the calculation. This is
    %   just a holder class for the individual data segments.
