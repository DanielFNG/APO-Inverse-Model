%% Human-APO Inverse Model - lsqlin
% When a human walks with aid of an exoskeleton the torques at the joints
% can be considered as a composite of effort from the human and the effect
% of the exoskeleton. In other words, we have:
%
% $$ \tau_{net} = \tau_{human} + \tau_{APO}. $$
%
% This script attempts to identify the forces which the exoskeleton
% (currently the Active Pelvis Orthosis aka APO) needs to apply in order to
% drive the human torque contribution towards some desired quantity
% $\tau_{desired}$. Rather than using a QP, which was the strategy of 
% previous implementations, this method attempts to find a least squares 
% solution of the underdetermined system with inequality constraints to 
% represent bounds on the magnitude of the APO torques.

%% Inverse model parameters.
% These parameters represent the free parameters of the inverse model,
% which in this case are equivalent to the parameters of the model for the
% application of APO forces. Currently APO forces are modelled as a force
% applied from a wrench measured at the APO motors, which are seen as being
% connected to the wearers thigh by a link of known distance. 
%
% If the APO force model becomes more complicated more parameters can be
% added, or alternatively parameters can be altered to investigate changes.
% Note that, should link length be changed here, the Jacobian mappings
% corresponding to the APO forces would have to be recalculated.
%
% Currently the number of timesteps is hard-coded at 119 but later when 
% mexing this script with C++ this should be calculated during execution.

%% Import the data we need. 
% The required data to perform the optimization includes: the net internal
% generalised forces calculated from the OpenSIM C++ API using the 
% getGeneralisedForces scrips; the Jacobian mappings from the
% left/right APO contact points on to generalised forces; and the time
% indexed states of the system calculated from RRA.
%
% For the time being this data has been pre-calculated. However, ideally a
% later step would be to MEX the required C++ code so as to have a 'one
% click solution' which calculates the require data within this script.

%% Initialise time-invariant variables.
% Here we set up arrays to store the optimisation results and the error 
% at each time-step. 
%
% We also set up an array to store the spatial forces applied by the APO 
% given in the ground frame - these are calculated from the optimisation 
% results given the known APO contact Jacobians, and are necessary to write
% an external forces file which will later be used in OpenSim simulations.
% This array also stores the CoP of these external forces as measured in
% the hip joint frame. For simplicity, the fact that the APO 'pushes' on 
% the back of the leg and 'pulls' on the front of the leg is for the 
% time-being abstracted out to a single point of external force located in 
% the middle of the leg. This point does not change with time and so the 
% CoP components of this array can be defined here. 
% 
% Additionally, we can also set up the inequality constraints here as these
% are independent of time.

    %% Calculate time-dependent variables. 
    % Here the dynamic variables pertaining to the APO which are 
    % time-dependent are calculated. 
    %
    % First, the normalised spatial forces describing the force applied
    % by the APO are calculated. While in theory these are spatial, since 
    % the APO applies a force perpendicular to the thigh and no torques
    % they are actually 2D, but are represented as spatial vectors for
    % implementation purposes. These are 'normalised' in the sense that
    % this is the spatial force applied by the left/right APO link when the
    % left/right APO motor is operating with 1Nm of torque. 
    %
    % Next, we isolate the time-indexed 6x23 APO Jacobians corresponding 
    % to this time-step (from an array which contains all of the
    % Jacobians), and take the transpose.
    %
    % Finally, we form the normalised component of the APO generalised
    % forces by multiplying the normalised APO forces by the transpose of
    % the Jacobian. Again, this is 'normalised' in the sense that this 
    % generalised APO torque corresponds to a measured torque of 1 at the
    % APO.

    %% Form linear system. 
    % Here we form the linear system for which a least squares based
    % solution is to be sought. The equations we aim to solve are the
    % following: 
    %
    % $$ {\bf A}{\bf \ddot{q}} + {\bf b} + {\bf g} = \tau_{grf} +
    % \tau_{APO} + \tau_{human}, $$
    %
    % $$ \tau_{APO} = \frac{A_{R}}{L}{\bf J^{T}_{L}}{\bf \hat{F}}^{L}_{applied} + \frac{A_{L}}{L}{\bf J^{T}_{R}}{\bf \hat{F}}^{R}_{applied}, $$
    %
    % $$ \tau_{human} = \tau_{desired}. $$
    %
    % The first equation above is the classical equation of motion.
    % Here, ${\bf A\ddot{q}}, {\bf b}$ and ${\bf g}$ are generalised forces
    % due to inertia, nonlinear effects and gravity, respectively. 
    % The vectors $\tau_{grf}$ and $\tau_{APO}$ are external forces due to 
    % ground reaction forces and the effect of the APO. The vector 
    % $\tau_{human}$ describes the generalised force due to the internal 
    % joint torques of the human. 
    %
    % The second equation describes that the generalised force due to the 
    % APO is caused by external forces at the left and right thigh. In 
    % this equation 6D normalised spatial force vectors (which are non-zero
    % in only the Fx and Fy directions, so are actually 2D) are scaled 
    % using the APO measured torques $A_{R}$ and $A_{L}$ and the link 
    % length $L$ and mapped from their point of application, namely the 
    % left and right thigh, on to generalised system forces via use of 
    % Jacobian mappings.
    %
    % Finally $\tau_{desired}$ is an input desired generalised force 
    % vector which we want the human torque contribution to be driven to. 
    %
    % Note that in matrix form they can be written as follows, after 
    % substituting equation 2 in to equation 1:
    %
    % $$ C{\bf x} = \left(\matrix{\frac{1}{L}J_{R}^{T}{\bf \hat{F}^{R}}_{applied}&\frac{1}{L}J_{L}^{T}{\bf \hat{F}^{L}}_{applied}&I_{23}\cr
    % O_{23,1}&O_{23,1}&I_{23}}\right)\left(\matrix{A_{R}\cr A_{L}\cr \tau_{human}}\right) $$
    %
    % $$ = \left(\matrix{{\bf A}{\bf \ddot{q}} + {\bf b} + {\bf g} - \tau_{grf}\cr \tau_{desired}}\right) = {\bf d}.$$
    %
    % Note that $C$ is a $46$ by $25$ matrix, ${\bf x}$ is a $25$ by $1$ 
    % column vector, and ${\bf b}$ is a $46$ by $1$ column vector. The 
    % first 23 elements of the vector d are equivalent to the net internal 
    % generalised forces calculated from getGeneralisedForces. The other 
    % half of d is chosen to achieve a certain behaviour of the human/APO 
    % system using the input desired torque. 
    %
    % The current implementation aims to achieve a percentage reduction in 
    % human joint torque at the left and right hip joints (flexion only).
    % This could be modified to aim for a percentage reduction over more 
    % joints. Indeed, this could be extended to requiring more effort at 
    % joints, or specifying that some joints receive more assistance 
    % than others. Finally, this vector could also be set to actual 
    % experimentally recorded joint torques in an attempt to drive the 
    % human torque contribution at one context towards another.

    % to the desired torque, the torque which should be applied to the 
    % APO motors. To analyse this output simulations will be run in 
    % OpenSim, explicitly providing these APO torques so as to calculate 
    % the resultant human torques as part of an OpenSim simulation. 
    % However, for simplicity the actual APO motors themselves aren't 
    % included in the OpenSim model. To represent the forces generated, 
    % the torques have to be mapped on to spatial forces which are applied
    % to the thighs of the user, which can then be unput as external forces
    % to OpenSim.  
    %
    % Earlier, the normalised spatial forces were calculated. We simply 
    % multiply these by our calculated APO motor torques to obtain the
    % corresponding spatial forces.
    %

%% Notes and further work
% End of current iteration of script. Future improvements include:
%
% - Currently the desired human torque is limited to a percentage decrease 
%   in human joint effort over one or more joints, for one or more
%   percentages. Will include support for specifying a time-indexed torque
%   profile to act as a desired torque (allowing for analysis between
%   walking contexts on real experimental data).
%
% - Greater integration between C++ API script and Matlab (i.e. MEXing).
%
% - More automation, i.e. no reading in data, having to organise data 
%   manually following script completion, etc. 
%
% - No hard-coding; the time-step should be able to be calculated from the 
%   steps mentioned above. 
%
% - Ultimately want to take as input an OpenSim model file, experimental 
%   data (namely IK calculated from experimental marker data using OpenSim,
%   and experimentally obtained grf forces), and a desired human torque
%   contribution profile. Then, from entirely within this script (using
%   MEXing etc), produce an output APO torque profile to achieve said
%   desired human contribution.
