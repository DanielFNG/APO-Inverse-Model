% Create cell arrays to hold the results.
% First index is the subject identifier, from 1-9 technically but not
% including 5 because we didn't get full data for this, but I'll still go from
% 1-9 since these are their subject numbers. 
% Second index is the type of assistance: 1 for no exo (NE), 2 for transparent
% (ET) and 3 for active (EA).
% Second index is left/right gait cycle. 1 for right, 2 for left.
% Third index is the number of gait cycles among the trials. (EA1, EA2
% etc). These are in the same order as they were recorded. So EA1 is
% nonstst, EA2 stst, etc.
