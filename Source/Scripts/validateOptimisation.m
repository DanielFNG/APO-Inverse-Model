%% validateOptimisation description and strategy
% This script is designed to validate that the optimisation is being solved
% correctly. To do this, the strategy is as follows:
%   - Consider a fixed set of input data (kinematics, ground reaction
%   forces), a scaled model, and the linear APO force model. 
%   - Using OpenSim, considering only the ground reaction forces, 
%   compute the dynamically consistent joint kinematics corresponding to this 
%   input data (1), and from this compute a set of joint torques (2).
%   - Consider also a set of arbitrary APO motor torques (3).
%   - Given these motor torques, use the linear APO force model to compute
%   the spatial forces which the APO would apply on the system. 
%   - Use OpenSim again, this time considering the ground reaction forces
%   and the APO spatial forces, and using the dynamically consistent joint
%   angles (1), compute another set of joint torques (4).
%   - Run the optimisation, taking (4) to be the input data and (2) to be
%   the desired. Among the results will be a set of APO motor torques
%   calculated via the optimisation (5).
%   - Compare (3) and (5). If the optimisation is functioning correctly,
%   they should agree well. 

%% Some parameters.

%% Set up desired.
% Construct an OpenSimTrial with only ground reaction forces.

    load_type_1, 'grf0.mot', trial_directory_1);

% Run ID.
id = id_trial.runID(start_time, end_time);

% Use this to set up the desired.
des = Desired('match_id', 'all', id);

%% Set up exoskeleton & model.
% Construct Exoskeleton and compute the force model.
apo = Exoskeleton('APO');
n = trial.human_dofs;
k = apo.Exo_dofs;
model = apo.constructExoskeletonForceModel(rra, model_directory, force_model);

%% Set up nominal APO motor torques. 
% Construct some nominal trajectories for the APO motor torques. Out of
% phase sin waves of amplitude 15.
x = 0:2*pi/999:2*pi;
y = 15*sin(x);
z = 15*sin(x+pi);
t = zeros(2,size(x,2));
t(1,1:end) = y;
t(2,1:end) = z;

% Calculate the spatial force resulting from these trajectories.
spatial = model.calculateSpatialForcesFromTorqueTrajectory(t.');

% Create a new external forces data object, and write it to file.
[ext, apo_only] = model.createExtForcesFileAPOSpecific(spatial);
ext.writeToFile('grf_withAPO.mot',1,1);
apo_only.writeToFile('grf_onlyAPO.mot',1,1);

%% Set up input data. 
% Construct an OpenSimTrial with ground reaction forces and APO forces.
APO_trial = OpenSimTrial('testing_adjusted.osim', 'ik0.mot', load_type_2, ...
    'grf_withAPO.mot', trial_directory_2);

% This step is commented out because it is slightly incorrect! See below
% for details.
    % Run RRA.

    % Construct a new OpenSimTrial using the RRA-corrected kinematics.

    %     load_type_2, 'grf_withAPO.mot', trial_directory_2);

% Construct a new OpenSimTrial using the RRA-corrected kinematics, but from
% the GRF only run. It is important to do this so that both the input and the 
% desired ID profiles comes from the same input kinematics data.
% Additionally, using the APO force model to produce the RRA means there
% will be errors in the RRA result due to force model inaccuracy. This is
% not the case when doing RRA on just the grfs which are known accurately.
% The only downside is we end up with a net (exo + human) RRA, but this is
% irrelevant here. 
id_APO_trial = OpenSimTrial('testing_adjusted.osim', rra.positions_path, ...
