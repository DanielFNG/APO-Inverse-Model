RapidXML is required in the getFrameJacobians script for reading
Exoskeleton settings files. I don't know why I've got this library
separate here. I could potentially add it to the folder for getFrameJacobians, 
although notably it isn't my source code and it is an external library. 
So I might just keep it. Remains to be seen.
